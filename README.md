# HTML/CSS
## Task description

Requirements:
- The layout should be displayed correctly in the latest versions of the following browsers: GC, Firefox, Safari.
- The page should be displayed correctly on different devices: smartphones, tablets, and desktops with different OSes.
- There should be no horizontal scrolling on displays with a width of 320px.
- The markup of the page should be semantically correct.
- The BEM methodology must be applied.

### Task 1
- Open index.html file in the task1 directory
- Check the markup and leave comments in the code above the lines to which the comment applies.
- Questions that might help you when assessing the project:
    - Is the markup semantic? Are there any tags or attributes that were used incorrectly?
    - Do all elements have the appropriate attributes set?
    - Are classes named in accordance with the BEM methodology? Are there any mistakes in naming or using blocks, elements, or modifiers?
    
    Note that you don't need to respond to these questions. They are just here to help you pay attention to certain parts of the code.

### Task 2
- Open index.html file in the task2 directory
- Leave your comments on the display of the layout at the end of the "index.html" file from the first task
  
- Questions that might help you when assessing the project:
  - Is everything okay with the styles, selectors, and block models, and is the content overflowing?
  - Was the adaptive page layout done correctly from your perspective?
  - Is everything okay with arrangement of elements in the grid and alignment of elements relative to each other?
  - Are there any other problems that make page worse?

  We do not provide a Figma layout for the assignment because most of the problems can be seen without it.
