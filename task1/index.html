    <!--  1. **Icons**: Replace <div> elements used for icons with dedicated tags like <i> or <svg>.

          3. **Dates**: Use the <time> tag for dates instead of <p>. This improves semantic accuracy and makes the dates machine-readable. More details: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time.

  <!-- Comments for Task 2 layout review:
    Well Done:
    - The modal structure is well-organized, with separate sections for login, sign-up, and success messages.
    - The use of <ul> to show links in the footer is a good practice for accessibility and semantic structure.
    - The use of a modal to show login, sign-up, and success messages is a good design choice for user interaction.
    - The use of a preloader section to indicate loading status is a good practice for user feedback.
    Good job!! Keep it up!

    Needs correcting:
    - When the page starts, the modal with the message is displayed. This can be confusing for users, as they might expect to see the main content first. Consider showing the main content first and then displaying the modal when necessary.
    - The preloader section should only be visible when the page is actively searching or loading content. Without conditional visibility, this section might display unnecessarily, causing confusion for users. Consider dynamically toggling the visibility of this section using JavaScript, such as adding or removing a "hidden" class or setting the display property. This will ensure a better user experience. Learn more about handling visibility dynamically here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style
    - The page is having an horizontal scrolling on displays with a width of 320px. This can be fixed by adjusting the layout to fit within the viewport width. Consider using responsive design techniques to ensure the content fits various screen sizes without horizontal scrolling. You can learn more about responsive design here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design
    - When the modal is open, is working well but when the screen is less than 767px the modal is not responsive, and occupied the entire screen. Consider making the modal responsive to different screen sizes to ensure a consistent user experience across devices. 
    - The icon to save the articles is not responsive and lost the position inside the card. The little message "Sign in to save articles" is not aligned with the icon. Consider adjusting the layout to ensure that icons and text remain properly aligned and responsive across different screen sizes.
    - The social media icons in the footer are not aligned correctly on smaller devices. Consider adjusting the alignment to ensure a consistent layout across different screen sizes.
    - The images in the cards should use specification to show to entire image and not only a part of it. Consider using the <img> tag with appropriate attributes, such as width and height, to ensure the images display correctly and maintain their aspect ratio. This will prevent images from being cropped or distorted on different devices. Learn more about image attributes here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img

    Can be improved:
    - The "About the author" section could have a different text alignment or spacing to make it more visually appealing and easier to read. Consider adjusting the layout or typography to enhance readability and user experience. You can experiment with different font sizes, line heights, or margins to improve the overall appearance.
    - The "Show more" button in the results section could be more descriptive. Consider using a more specific label, such as "Load More Articles," to clearly indicate the action users will take. Descriptive labels improve usability and help users understand the purpose of the button.
